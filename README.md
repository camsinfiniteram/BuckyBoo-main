We know you're all busy: who has the time to spend hours comparing classes? But with Bucky Boo, you can make a roster and determine which are hot or not! The mysterious painting class that you meet with twice a week, the intimidating but irresistible chem class you've been eyeing for the past two semesters. Even the CS class that can't commit, except when it comes to Git.

Enter Bucky Boo: the AI-powered course matching app by UW-Madison students, for UW-Madison students. With Bucky Boo, you can swipe on classes based on what you've already taken. If our wires are fried, we have a rating system for current and former students to weigh in on each class. Our mission is to create the an enrollment experience tailored to students' individual interests. 

Haven't you heard? Busy Badgers love Badger Boo.
